## Overview and Origin:

* **Name of company/project?** Stellar

* **When was the company/project incorporated?** July 31, 2014

* **Who are the founders of the company?** Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple and founder of Mt.Gox, with a former lawyer named Joyce Kim. [[1]](#1)

* **How did the idea for the company/project come about?** The idea for Stellar came from the founders, Jed and Joyce, wanting to create a cryptocurrency that would serve as a link between fiat, digital or other currencies while also reducing transaction costs to make it easier for people living in more rural or unfortunate communities to access money. [[2]](#2)

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?** They are backed by a Delaware nonprofit corporation, the Stellar Development Foundation, whom also collaberated with a payments company called Stripe that ended up investing 3 million in funds to Stellar. [[3]](#3)


## Business Activities:

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?** Stellar is trying to solve the issue of the slow and expensive exchange of money, especially when it comes to underresourced communities.
* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?** The company's intended customer is everyone, but especially those who live in disadvantaged communities. The market size can be billions because Stellar will be a globally used cryptocurrency.

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?** *(What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)* Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, such as Ripple for example, Stellar is a decentralized protocol. [[4]](#4) This allows less opportunity for data loss from companies, no trust needed in others in the network, a decrease of potential weakpoints in the system, and overall better optimization. [[5]](#5)

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** For Application and Data: JavaScript, jQuery, Python, PHP, Java, CloudFlare, TypeScript, CSS 3, Modernizr, Ruby, Go, C++, Objective-C, C, Shell, Lua, Visual Basic, and Smarty.
For Utilities: Google Anazlytics, Google Tag Manager, Segment, and Crazy Egg.
For DevOps: Docker, TrackJS, and CMake.
For Business Tools: Gmail, WordPress, and Mailchimp. [[6]](6) They're implementing them by using them to help their website, Stellar.org and continuing their development updates on their cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens.

## Landscape:

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?** Stellar is in the Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies domain. Blockchain is a type of storage structure that collects and holds sets of information together in groups, called blocks. The chain in blockchain comes from the fact that when said block storage capacities are filled they are then chained onto previously filled blocks creating a chain of data. [[7]](#7)

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?** Although there have been crashes here and there because of high volatility, overall the trend with cryptocurrencies is they are becoming more and more popular and valuable as time goes on and their prices have generally risen in the past 5-10 years. [[8]](#8)

* **What are the other major companies in this domain?** Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Oracle Blockchain Cloud Service, Blockstream. [[9]](#9)


## Results:

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?** Stellar has continued to contest the idea of traditonal finance and banking institutions with it's cryptocurrency, the Stellar Lumen. By it's continuous development, increased partnerships, funds, and investments, Stellar is sure to proceed to make better transfers of money across the globe.

* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?** Because of the early maturity of cryptocurrency, there is a limited measure of their true success, such as utility, thus far. Instead, one of the main core metrics that companies in this domain use is market cap. As of the month of August, there's approximately 5,800 cryptocurriencies and Stellar is rated number 22 which would mean it's performing incredibly well. [[10]](#10)

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?** Compared to competitors like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Stellar may seem a bit behind. However, since they're the 22nd top cryptocurrency amongst over 5,000 other cryptocurrencies, they're doing incredibly well in the grand scheme of cryptos in general.


## Recommendations:

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?** *(This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)* Have a digital Stellar rewards card which will award points and incentivize people to use Stellar more often to get better deals by using the points for anything, from buying whatever they want out of their favorite stores all the way to airline miles.

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?** I think the digital Stellar rewards card would benefit the company because it would help popularize the Stellar Lumens cryptocurrency. The more Stellar Lumens get's adopted and becomes more widespread, the more people it can help and the bigger it can get, meaning bigger workforce, more money circulation and better software updates and product.

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?** This loyalty program would utilitze smart app and pay experience technology.

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?** These tenchnologies are appropriate to my solution because it would keep everything digital making it easier to hold onto your money, buy what you want and then after exchange your accumilated reward points into tangeable items.
